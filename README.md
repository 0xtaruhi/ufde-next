These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

#### Rust & Cargo

Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) first. Recommended installation method is via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

#### pnpm

Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) first. Optionally, you can use npm or yarn instead.

### Installing

After cloning the repository, run the following command to install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Then, run the following command to start the application:

```bash
pnpm tauri dev
```

This will start the application in development mode. You can also build the application by running the following command:

```bash
pnpm tauri build
```

This will build the application for your current platform. You can find the built application in the `src-tauri/target/release` directory.
